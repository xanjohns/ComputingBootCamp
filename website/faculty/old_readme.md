# The BYU Computing BootCamp

# Bootcamp Planning for 2021

### Published Units (in SelfPaced directory)
These are self-paced learning activities on the wiki.  Typically, they have the students read about topic, install the tool, and then complete a series of mini-projects to actually use the topic's tool and do some useful things with it.

Last year we gave them a schedule to follow and adjusted it as some things took longer/shorter than we thought.  I took a guess at grouping them into weeks for this year.

#### Week 1
- Getting The Pre-Canned Linux Virtual Machine
    - Creating Your Own Virtual Machine Instructions
- Learning Linux - Reference Materials
- Customizing Your Linux VM

#### Week 2
- Vivado Tcl: Command Line Scripting Using the Tcl Language
    - Using `vivado -mode tcl` for command line usage (non-project mode)
    - Using Tcl to control Vivado operation and synthesis/implementation phases
    - Writing Tcl programs to analyze/manipulate designs

#### Week 3
- Git, Github, Github Best Practices
- RapidWright Bootcamp
    - RapidWright Interchange Format

#### Week 4
- Symbiflow Bootcamp
    - Prjxray
    - FASM, fasm2bits, ...
    - Fasm2Bels

#### Week 5
- Symbiflow-VTR Bootcamp

### Group Talk Schedule
These are talks presented by faculty/students (mostly faculty) at our weekly meetings.  Last year we met 2x/week during May, then the Immerse talks started up on Wednesdays and so we switched to 1x/week until mid-July.

- Ideas from Tim
  - EDALize == Python library for "controlling" EDA tools.
  - FuseSoC == apt-get for IP cores.
  - You really need a general section on Docker / Containers too (like your Git sections).
    - Once you have that, it is very easy to use the containers from https://GitHub.com/HDL/containers with Edalize thanks to https://twitter.com/OlofKindgren/status/1374848733746192394?s=20
    - We want to support this as an alternative to conda in our user and development environments in the future.
