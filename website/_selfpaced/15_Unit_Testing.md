## Lecture Videos
On May 17, 2021 we had a Pytest Tutorial by Prof Goeders and a GoogleTest tutorial by Prof Mangelson. The videos are embedded below

### GoogleTest-for C/C++

There are many different methods that can be used to perform unittesting in C++ and C.

Some of the most frequently used frameworks include:
* Catch - <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>
* Boost.Test - <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html>
* Google Test - <https://github.com/google/googletest>

Each library/framework supports different functionality and comes with its own trade offs.

In this module, we will use Google Test to provide a short example.
