            Bootcamp is a summer program for new students (mostly undergraduates) which provides them training and
            experience computing technologies required to perform research in a variety of Computer Engineering topics.
            Examples of these technologies include VS Code, git, cmake and make, Conda, etc. <br><br>

            For some of these topics there are self-paced pages with learning activities followed by mini-projects. For
            others there are just learning activites. For some there are links to video lectures on the topic. <br><br>

            In addition, Bootcamp also provides discipline-specific training. Bootcamp started in 2020 with an initial
            focus on FPGA's and associated topics such as Tcl/Vivado and Project XRay. Additional areas besides FPGAs
            may be added in the future. <br><br>

            The different groups of topics (general computing vs. discipline-specific) can be used independently. That
            is, they do not contain dependencies on each other other and so you could use them as you see fit.

            This page is currently being updated/renovated for Spring 2021 and so some pages may be incomplete or under
            construction. <br><br>
